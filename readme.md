# AAAASM

or **A**nna's **A**ttempt **A**t **A**ssembly.

A fun side project to made a very simple assembly language interpreter.
Should eventually include a visual interpreter as a debugging aid. Will also
include a CLI for running programs without a GUI. The program will primarily
be accessed through the CLI however.
